# Building a Monorepo with pnpm Workspaces: My Journey

Hey everyone! Today, I want to share a bit about my experience setting up a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. If you've ever juggled multiple related projects, you know the pain of duplicated dependencies, inconsistent tooling, and complex release processes. That's where monorepos, especially with a tool like pnpm, really shine.

## Why pnpm Workspaces?

Before diving into the "how," let's talk about the "why." For my "diff-apps" project, which includes an `admin-app`, a `user-app`, and a `common-ui` library, a monorepo was a no-brainer. But why pnpm specifically?

1. **Efficient Dependency Management:** pnpm is a game-changer here. Instead of duplicating `node_modules` across every package, pnpm uses a content-addressable store to link dependencies. This means faster installs, less disk space, and a much cleaner project structure.
2. **Strictness:** Unlike npm or yarn, pnpm is stricter about how dependencies are accessed. This helps prevent "phantom dependencies" (where a package implicitly relies on a dependency of another package without declaring it itself), leading to more robust and predictable builds.
3. **Simplicity:** The workspace setup with pnpm is incredibly straightforward. A simple `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file at the root defines your packages, and `pnpm install` handles the rest, linking local packages automatically.

## My Monorepo Structure

In my "diff-apps" project, the structure looks something like this:

```txt
diff-apps/
├── packages/
│   ├── admin-app/
│   ├── user-app/
│   └── common-ui/
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── package.json
```

Each directory under `packages/` is its own pnpm package. The `common-ui` library, for instance, can be easily imported and used by both `admin-app` and `user-app` without any complex publishing or linking steps.

## Key Utilities and Commands

Once you have your workspace set up, pnpm provides some fantastic utilities to manage it:

* **`pnpm install`**: Run this from the monorepo root to install all dependencies for all packages and link local packages. It's surprisingly fast!
* **`pnpm -r <command>`**: This is your best friend for running commands across all packages. For example, `pnpm -r build` will build every package in your monorepo. This was super useful for my `diff-apps` project to build all applications and the `common-ui` library with a single command.
* **`pnpm run <script-name>`**: You can define scripts in your root `package.json` that can then execute scripts within individual packages. For example, I have `dev:user` and `dev:admin` scripts that start the development servers for the respective applications.

## A Small Hiccup (and a Workaround)

One minor challenge I encountered was with TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) for the `common-ui` package. Automatic generation wasn't fully functional initially. As a temporary fix, I added `shims-common-ui.d.ts` files to `user-app` and `admin-app`. This allowed me to continue development without TypeScript errors, and the runtime functionality was unaffected. It's a minor point, but it highlights that even with great tools, sometimes you need a little workaround!

## The Benefits Are Clear

Adopting pnpm workspaces for my monorepo has significantly streamlined my development workflow. It's made dependency management a breeze, improved build times, and provided a consistent environment across all my related applications. But the advantages of a monorepo go even further:

*   **Simplified Code Sharing:** With all related projects in one repository, sharing code and components (like my `common-ui` library) becomes incredibly easy. You don't need to publish packages to a registry just to use them in another part of your application. This fosters reusability and reduces duplication.
*   **Atomic Changes:** When a change affects multiple projects (e.g., an update to the shared UI library that impacts both the admin and user apps), you can make all the necessary modifications in a single commit. This ensures that all parts of your system are always compatible with each other, reducing integration issues and simplifying rollbacks.
*   **Easier Refactoring:** Refactoring across project boundaries is much simpler in a monorepo. Tools can analyze the entire codebase, making it easier to identify all affected areas and ensure that changes are applied consistently.
*   **Consistent Tooling and Practices:** A monorepo encourages the use of consistent build tools, linters, and coding standards across all projects. This reduces cognitive load for developers, makes onboarding new team members smoother, and improves overall code quality.
*   **Streamlined CI/CD:** Setting up continuous integration and deployment pipelines can be more efficient in a monorepo. You can configure a single pipeline to build, test, and deploy all your applications, or set up intelligent pipelines that only run tests and deployments for projects affected by a particular change.
*   **Enhanced Visibility:** Having all related code in one place provides a holistic view of your entire system. Developers can easily navigate between different applications and libraries, understand dependencies, and see how changes in one area might affect others.

If you're considering a monorepo, I highly recommend giving pnpm a try. It's been a game-changer for me!
